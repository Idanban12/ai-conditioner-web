# Notes on Spiral Transitions in GLSL Shaders

1. **Gradual Transition**  
   Instead of abruptly switching between pulsation patterns, gradually transition from one to another over a period of time. This can be done by slowly altering the frequency of the pulses.  
   - Keep transitions slow and subtle to avoid startling the subject.

2. **Sync with Breathing**  
   If the subject’s breathing rhythm is synchronized with the visual stimuli, syncing the transition with their breath can help make it less noticeable.  
   - For example, initiate the change at the top or bottom of a breathing cycle.

3. **Smooth Visual Fade**  
   While transitioning between patterns, incorporate a brief visual fade or overlay to mask the change.  
   - This could be a gradual dimming or brightening of the central light.  
   - Alternatively, use a gradual change in color that corresponds with the transition.

4. **Use Guided Imagery**  
   If you have control over the audio, use guided imagery or suggestions that align with the transition.  
   - This helps divert the subject’s attention from the visual change.

5. **Pacing and Timing**  
   Ensure the transition occurs at a moment in the hypnotic session when the subject is deeply engaged and less likely to notice external changes.  
   - Timing is crucial for a seamless transition.

6. **Practice and Testing**  
   Before using the visual in an actual session, test the transition multiple times to ensure it’s as smooth and unobtrusive as possible.

7. **Feedback**  
   Collect feedback from individuals unfamiliar with the transition.  
   - Adjust based on their observations.
